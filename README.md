# dt-swiss-rws-axis-handle

So, one day I kinda dropped my bicycle and it broke a plastic handle on the rear hub axle. I looked it up and turns out that this kind of axles are called [RWS](https://www.dtswiss.com/en/technology/components/rws-technology/), sometimes they are totally usable without any handle, but for me, it was not the case (I got the one called `HWQASM00S9566S`), you can see it [here](https://www.dtswiss.com/en/products/hubs-rws/rws/12-mm/).  There are places you can buy a replacement part for around $15, but I decided to try and 3D print a replacement and see if it will work.

It is not printed or tested yet. After I try it out I will update this repo and tell whether it was a success or not.
